# Resting-HR-Prediction

### Description

Learning about machine learning and linear regression and thought I would try to make some code that would predict what my resting HR would be based off variables such as sleep, injury, sickness and more.


### Notes

- Feel free to adjust the variable to try and get more accurate results
- I've only tested this with three weeks of data and hasn't been very accurate
